* need to be able to arbitrarily CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) notes and rests and measures
* right now changes to flat io seem to get messed up
  * diff is wrong. instead of `if (onScoreUpdate && JSON.stringify(json) !== JSON.stringify(flatJSON)) {`
    * do a "logical diff" of the measures (not EVERY property, just like notes and rests and whatnot)
* https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/musicxml-reference/elements/divisions/ (maybe not exactly this property, but maybe so, and that's nearly the right link)
* somehow the order of the notes in the measure gets flipped when we use flat editor to change whole to quarter (flat shows quarter note of previous pitch, followed by 3 quarter rests, but blockly has the note last preceded by the rests)
