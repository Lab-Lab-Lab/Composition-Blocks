# how is this thing going to work?
1. this is all react
1. there will be some component which will invoke 2 other components. right now it's App
1. start with a blank score (all rests) and show the programming blocks and the musical staff as a flat embed for that "blank" score
1. if the user edits either representation, the other should update
1. to know the starting state, we need to pass in to the 2 components some starting value to visualize
1. to know that something has changed, we need to pass in to each component a function to call when that component realizes it has made a change
1. to review: each component requires at least 2 inputs: the state to visualize and the function to call if it changes the state
1. react's whole job is to notice when a variable's value has changed and to have a list of references to that var so that it can rerender when the var changes, this requires the dev not to use a local var, but to use useState or some other react hook
