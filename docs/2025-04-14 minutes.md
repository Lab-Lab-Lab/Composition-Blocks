1. we need to tell blockly what's allowed
  * only measures in the root
  * measures can't nest
1. what if a blockly block (in blocklyjson) has its `inputs` property set to an object where that object's `NOTES` property is an object whose `block` property is `null`?
  * usually
    ```
    {
    "blocks": {
      "languageVersion": 0,
      "blocks": [
        {
          "type": "measure",
          "id": "Af#N]PUx}S)6yjqNn(,Z",
          "x": 50,
          "y": 0,
          "inputs": {
            "NOTES": {
              "block": {
                "type": "play_sound",
                "id": "X$8ps8j86EDlJLR5ocb2",
                "fields": {
                  "DURATION": "whole",
                  "STEP": "E",
                  "OCTAVE": "4"
                }
              }
            }
          },
          "next": {
            "block": {
              "type": "measure",
              "id": "{h*}Cl}R)=`h57_le+@J",
              ...
    ```
  * problem:
    ```
    {
  "blocks": {
    "languageVersion": 0,
    "blocks": [
      {
        "type": "measure",
        "id": "Af#N]PUx}S)6yjqNn(,Z",
        "x": 50,
        "y": 0,
        "inputs": {
          "NOTES": {
            "block": null
          }
        },
        "next": {
          "block": {
            "type": "measure",
            "id": "{h*}Cl}R)=`h57_le+@J",
            ...
    ```


For solution look to changelistener and type + isStart (something like that)

so like if the user is dragging, dont call onchange
